          \vspace{0.25em}\textbf{Technical Lead} for OnCall Service, a translation layer between a vendor alerting product and internal infrastructure.
          Functionality included a REST API, complex caching requirements, Slack integration, error handling, scalability, and reliability.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Drove the product from its origin as an intern project to a key component of several critical systems, with 200+ unique users internally.
            \item Complemented by manager for my ability to quickly identify and resolve complex issues with excellent user service.
            \item Wrote and maintained the primary backend in Java using Dropwizard and Google Guava, with extensive integration testing through our CI/CD service.
            \item Recognized by manager by consistently receiving above-average discretionary performance bonuses.
          \end{itemize}

          \vspace{0.25em}\textbf{Individual Contributor} on a top-priority crossteam initiative to restructure release path controls.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Led integration with existing legacy workflows across multiple teams: gathering requirements, understanding technical problems, learning new tools and API frameworks.
            \item Drove implementation of new microservice to monitor Jira queues and ensure accountability and approval for production-critical releases.
          \end{itemize}

          \vspace{0.25em}\textbf{Individual Contributor} on a crossteam pilot of Web Components technology.
          Worked with two other teams to rewrite existing web UIs to reduce code size, duplication, and technical debt by an estimated 70\%.

          \vspace{0.25em}\textbf{Intern Manager and Buddy}
          Selected by manager to provide guidance, mentoring, and technical coaching for three interns.

          \vspace{0.25em}\textbf{Interviewer}
