\jobresponsibilities{Selected Projects \& Initiatives}

\begin{role}{Model Release Governance -- Approval Orchestration via Workflow Engine}
    \item Took ownership of an ambiguous, high-priority compliance need with a tight deadline; independently investigated approval constraints and existing workflows.
    \item Designed and implemented â€œMRS Jira," a service integrating Jira and Temporal to enforce approval policy through automated state transitions.
    \item Controlled release gating without developer disruption; system became standard for model and pipeline deployments firmwide, meeting compliance requirements within projected timeframe.
\end{role}

\begin{role}{Developer Support Integration -- On-Call Scheduling Layer}
    \item Built a backend integration service surfacing on-call coverage and contact metadata used by 1,800+ engineers within existing tools like the internal product catalog.
    \item Eliminated critical outage incidents caused by direct calls exceeding vendor's strict firmwide rate limit.
    \item Exposed simplified REST API over vendor alerting system with complex caching and supplemental Slack-based UX; system saw daily org-wide usage with minimal required behavior change.
\end{role}

\begin{role}{UI Modernization}
    \item Volunteered beyond core role to partner with JobSystem team on consolidating UIs using shared Web Components, reducing total code by 70\%.
    \item Developed and integrated the modular UI into Support Manager, aligning with frontend platform standards and internal migration goals.
\end{role}

\begin{role}{Mentorship, Hiring, and Culture}
    \item Mentored interns who shipped production-level backend code; conducted 50+ technical interviews and trained new interviewers.
    \item Led internal workshops on ham radio, 3D printing, and soldering to foster technical curiosity and community.
